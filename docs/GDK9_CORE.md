# Gdk9 Core Concepts

- Ninefold Grid: Energy compresses into 1–9 via digital root. `9` represents the full cycle (0 mod 9).
- Category Weights: Letters, digits, and symbols can be weighted independently via `weights` to reflect domain emphasis.
- Symbol Energies: Non-alphanumerics map to explicit energies (1–9), making punctuation/util symbols directly utilizable.
- Harmonic Triads: Residues group as Root (1,4,7), Wave (2,5,8), Peak (3,6,9) to describe qualitative texture of text.
- Sigils: Visual encodings (grid/bar) derived from distribution and totals for quick “energy posture” reads.

These are configurable in a principle file and surfaced in the CLI through `--mode extended`, `synthesize`, and `attune/optimize` commands.
